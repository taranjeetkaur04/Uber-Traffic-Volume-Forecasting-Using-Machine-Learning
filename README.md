🚦 Traffic Volume Prediction & Business Impact Analysis for Uber 🚗

📍 Project: Predictive Modeling for Traffic Volumes at Road Junctions

MentorMind Internship Project | August 2025 | Upgrad Campus

📝 Project Overview
Developed a predictive model to accurately forecast traffic volumes at different road junctions using historical traffic data.
The goal is to analyze traffic patterns and understand their impact on Uber’s business operations, optimizing strategies for peak times and congestion management.

✅ What I Have Done So Far
📊 1. Data Collection & Integration
Collected historical traffic data from provided datasets.

Researched additional relevant factors (weather, time, location).

Integrated and cleaned the datasets to prepare for modeling.

🧹 2. Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistent formats.
Engineered features such as:
Day of week
Hour of day
Weather conditions (temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind speed)
Holiday/Non-Holiday indicators

🔍 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
Visualized traffic patterns across different junctions.
Identified peak hours and congestion trends.
Analyzed correlations between weather and traffic volume.

🧠 4. Predictive Modeling
Built initial predictive models to forecast traffic volume:
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
Evaluated models using metrics like MAE, RMSE, R² Score.

📈 5. Business Impact Analysis
Prepared a report on “Effect of Traffic on Uber’s Business”:
How traffic congestion affects ride availability, ETAs, and revenue.
Business recommendations for traffic-based pricing and resource allocation.

📄 6. Report & Documentation
Uploaded the detailed business report:

Currently finalizing the Jupyter Notebook for public sharing.
